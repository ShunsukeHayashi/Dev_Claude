## Migration Guide

### From Manual Extraction to YAML Context Engineering Agent

1. **Install the MCP server**
   ```bash
   cd mcp-server
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Configure Claude Code**
   - Copy `.claude/` directory to your project
   - Update `settings.json` with your paths

3. **Run extraction**
   ```
   /extract-context https://your-docs.com
   ```

4. **Access generated content**
   - Check `generated_contexts/` directory
   - Review YAML frontmatter
   - Use quality analyzer for validation
